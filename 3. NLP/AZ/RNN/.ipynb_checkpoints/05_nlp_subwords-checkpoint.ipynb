    "What's in a (sub)word?\n",
    "In this colab, we'll work with subwords, or words made up of the pieces of larger words, and see how that impacts our network and related embeddings.\n",
    "We’ve worked with full words before for our sentiment models, and found some issues right at the start of the lesson when using character-based tokenization. Subwords are another approach, where individual words are broken up into the more commonly appearing pieces of themselves. This helps avoid marking very rare words as OOV when you use only the most common words in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the video, this can further expose an issue affecting all of our models up to this point, in that they don’t understand the full context of the sequence of words in an input. The next lesson on recurrent neural networks will help address this issue.\n",

    "Subword Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of already created subwords datasets available online. If you check out the IMDB dataset on TFDS https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews, for instance, by scrolling down you can see datasets with both 8,000 subwords as well as 32,000 subwords in a corpus (along with regular full-word datasets).\n",
